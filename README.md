# GAIO.jl

Seminar content can be found in `seminar/` (everything previous in this repository was moved there).

Currently, we have tests (as a separate project for now), and documentation modules installed, benchmarks are to be done. As a shortcut, both can be called using the integrated makefile (`make test` for tests, `make documentation` for documentation, and soon `make benchmark` for running benchmarks). Also, there is a file for Gitlab CI integration which does not do anything right now, unless somebody of us sets up a runner or finds a (free) service which does that (and is usable for closed-to-public repositories). If we do not do that, we can delete the file for now. In case we make this repository public later or move it to another Git hosting service, we will have to change it eventually as well.

Therefore, these badges here do not work right now, as they depend on a working CI runner.
