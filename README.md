This will be the next generation of [GAIO](https://github.com/gaioguy/GAIO) - currently under development.

The package provides a framework for set oriented computations, in particular for dynamical systems.
It allows to compute, e.g.,
   * invariant sets (e.g. periodic points, attractors, chain recurrent sets) of arbitrary dimension or topology,
   * invariant manifolds (stable/unstable manifolds of an arbitrary invariant set),
   * invariant measures, almost invariant sets, coherent sets.
