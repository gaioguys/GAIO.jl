# Limit Sets and Invariance

### The ``\omega``-limit set

The ``\omega``-limit set describes the asymptotic behavior of trajectories based on some fixed starting points. It is the set which is "reached after infinite time". For some starting set ``S`` in the domain ``X``, let ``O^k (S) = \bigcup_{n \geq k} f^n (S)`` be the set ``S`` at all times _after_ ``k`` iterations. Now, 
```math
\omega (S) = \bigcap_{k \geq 0} \overline{O^k (S)} . 
```
By taking the intersection over all ``k``, we are "stripping away" all finite-time behavior, leaving only the set which is maintained in infinite time. 

Let us lift this definition onto the `BoxMap` `F` over some `BoxGrid` `𝒫` and initial set `𝒮 ⊂ 𝒫`. We give `𝒫` the discrete topology so that ``\overline{O^k (𝒮)} = O^k (𝒮)`` and hence the ``\omega``-limit set reduces to ``\omega (𝒮) = \bigcap_{k \geq 0} F^k (𝒮)``. This can be easily iteratively obtained by 
```julia
function my_ω(F, S)
    Sₖ = S
    Sₖ₊₁ = empty(S)

    while Sₖ₊₁ ≠ Sₖ
        Sₖ = Sₖ₊₁
        Sₖ₊₁ = Sₖ ∩ F(Sₖ)
    end

    return Sₖ
end
```
Since `𝒫` is finite, this iteration must halt after finitely many steps. 

```@example 1
using GAIO

# the Henon map
const a, b = 1.4, 0.3
f((x,y)) = (1-a*x^2+y, b*x)

c, r = (0, 0), (3, 3)
X = Box(c, r)
𝒫 = BoxGrid(X, (40,40))
F = BoxMap(f, 𝒫)
𝒮 = cover(𝒫, :)

A = ω(F, 𝒮, subdivision=false)

using Plots

p = plot(A);

using Plots: savefig # hide
p = plot(A, dpi=500) # hide
savefig("omega_limit.png"); nothing # hide
```

Provided the `BoxMap` is accurate enough, this is now a covering of the original ``\omega``-limit set. This is useful since we may now refine the `BoxSet` which was returned by `ω(F, S)`, and run the iteration once more

```julia
function my_ω_with_subdivision(F, S, steps)
    for _ in 1:steps
        S = my_ω(F, subdivide(S))
    end
    return S
end
```

```@example 1
A = ω(F, A, subdivision=true, steps=12)

p = plot(A); 

p = plot(A, dpi=500) # hide
savefig("omega_limit_subdivide.png"); nothing # hide
```

In GAIO.jl this subdivision algorithm is built into `ω` via the `subdivision` kwarg, `ω(F::BoxMap, S::BoxSet; subdivision = false)`. Moreover, the number of iterations can be capped using the `steps` kwarg.

### The ``\alpha``-limit set

The ``\alpha``-limit set is the "time-reversed" ``\omega``-limit set
```math
\alpha (S) = \bigcap_{k \geq 0} \overline{O^{-k} (S)} . 
```
where ``O^{-k} (S) = \bigcup_{n \geq k} f^{-n} (S)`` and ``f^{-n} (A)`` is the preimage of ``A`` under ``f^n``. When we again lift this definition to `BoxMap`s, we arrive at ``\alpha (𝒮) = \bigcap_{k \geq 0} F^{-k} (𝒮)``, so that the previous algorithms still work with ``F^{-1}`` (the preimage function) replacing ``F``, 
```julia
function α(F, S)
    F⁻¹(B) = preimage(F, B, B)   # actually computes  F⁻¹(B) ∩ B  
    return ω(F⁻¹, S)             # which is all we need
end
```
Here too, this is implemented in GAIO.jl with the `subdivision` and `steps` kwargs.

### Invariant Sets

The ``\omega``-limit set has the property that 
```math
f^{-1} (\omega(S)) = \omega(S) . 
```
Analogously, the ``\alpha``-limit set satisfies 
```math
f (\alpha(S)) = \alpha(S) . 
```
Other sets which satisfy such conditions are called _backward (resp. forward) invariant_. A set which is both backward and forward invariant is just called invariant. 

An exercise shows that ``\omega(S)`` (resp. ``\alpha(S)``) is in fact the _largest_ subset of ``S`` which is backward (resp. forward) invariant. For this reason, the synonyms 
```julia
maximal_backward_invariant_set = ω
maximal_forward_invariant_set = α
```
are made available in GAIO.jl. For historical reasons [Dellnitz.Hohmann.1996](@cite), the synonym  
```julia
relative_attractor = ω
```
is also available. 

Finally, after reading through the above algorithms the reader likely already has an idea for how to compute the maximal invariant subset of ``S``, 
```julia
function maximal_invariant_set(F, S)
    G(B) = F(B) ∩ preimage(F, B, B)   # computes  F⁻¹(B) ∩ B ∩ F(B)  
    return ω(G, S)
end
```
Of course, the kwargs `subdivision` and `steps` are available here as well.
