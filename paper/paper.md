# Summary

GAIO (Global Analysis of Invariant Objects) is a software package for set
oriented computations in dynamical systems. These include isolating attractors,
discretizing invariant measures and computing their transfer behaviors, among
others. The algorithms that make up GAIO have been rebuilt from the ground up
using the Julia programming language; the result is a package in which
pseudocode for set-oriented algorithms can be written nearly verbatim an
executed with high performance.
